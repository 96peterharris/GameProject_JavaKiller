	<b><p>JavaKiller.vcxproj:</p></b>
		<p style="margin-left: 30px;"> This is the main project file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard.
  		It contains information about the version of Visual C++ that generated the file, and
		information about the platforms, configurations, and project features selected with the
		Application Wizard.</p>
	<b><p>JavaKiller.vcxproj.filters:</p></b>  
 		<p style="margin-left: 30px;"> This is the filters file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard. 
 		It contains information about the association between the files in
